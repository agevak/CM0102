Turns CM into benchmarker.

Minimal version includes:
1) Remove pause between matches.
2) Go on holiday automatically if CM .exe called with '-load xxx.sav' argument.
3) Stop holiday on 31st May. 'Enable your potiential to grow' patch should be NOT installed (interference)!

Full version includes also:
1) No substitutes (works only during new game generation).
2) No attribute changes.
3) No persistent injuries. Injuries can occur during matches, but do not perist after matches.
   To clear initial injuries during new game generation, manually delete/clear "Data\player_setup.cfg" file.
4) No manager sacking.
5) Condition becomes 100% after rest. Condition drops normally during matches, but recovers to 100% between matches.

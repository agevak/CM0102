Turns CM into benchmarker.

Minimal version includes:
1) Remove pause between matches.
2) Go on holiday automatically if CM .exe called with '-load xxx.sav' argument.
3) 31st May, prints league table to file and terminates the game. In order to work properly, division ID must be injected into CM process memory.
   This is implemented in Benchmarker application.
   'Enable your potiential to grow' patch should be NOT installed (interference)!
